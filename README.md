# Clipboard-Chat-Application 
## First real app I've ever made 😎. Built in Embarcadero RAD 13 using C++. First real challenge in my programming career.🤠

Folder contains:

-Client: Used to run the client side of the project, cannot run without server side. ✅

-Server: Ensures to log every user action and send packages to every single client. ✅

Here is an example of Client 1 discussing with Client 2 and using most of the application's functionalities.
